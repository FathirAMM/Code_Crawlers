# Project Name

## Description

This project is a full-stack web application built with React.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend. It serves as a boilerplate for creating web applications that require dynamic frontend interactions and a robust backend server.

## Features

- **React Frontend**: Utilizes React.js to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Flask Backend**: Employs Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to handle server-side logic and API requests.
- **RESTful API**: Implements a RESTful API architecture for communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Database Integration**: Easily integrates with various databases such as SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.
- **Authentication**: Provides authentication mechanisms such as JWT tokens for securing endpoints and managing user sessions.
- **Scalable**: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy expansion and addition of new features.
- **Customizable**: Offers a modular structure that enables developers to customize and extend functionalities according to project requirements.
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/FathirAMM/Code_Crawlers/
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd Code_Crawlers-main
    ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

    ```
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

4. Install backend dependencies:

    ```
    cd ..
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:

    ```
    cd ..
    cd backend
    python app.py
    ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

    ```
    cd ..
    cd newfolder
    npm start
    ```

3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

- **Backend Configuration**: Modify `config.py` file in the backend directory to adjust server configurations such as database settings, secret keys, etc.
  
- **Frontend Configuration**: Update `src/config.js` file in the newfolder directory to specify backend API endpoints or any other frontend settings.
